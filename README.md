memory addresses from 2000h to 2004h. In the end,
your memory must look like this:

## Second Project :
Write an assembly program which is able to write a given set of
characters in an array to another array in reverse order. For
example; if an array A is [‘c’ ‘e’ ‘n’ ‘g’] then array B must be [‘g’ ‘n’ ‘e’
‘c’].
